### Day 1

Class exercise writing a multiple choice question:

What is the most effective method for troubleshooting a new error message?
a) re-run the exact command
b) read through the entire manual/documentation for the software program or command
c) copy and paste the error message into Google and run a search
d) ask your supervisor or PI how to fix it


Formative Assessment should be done with your class/workshop every 10-15 minutes

* Sticky Notes (blue and pink - for color blindness)
* Multiple choice questions on Etherpad

Carpentries workshop use the following assessment tools: 

* Pre- and post- workshop surveys
* One up, One Down - one positive, one negative on two different colored post its
* Minute cards - write ‘one thing you learned or liked’ on one side/on the green note and ‘one thing you’re confused about’ on the other side/on the red sticky note 

### Day 2

Introductions:

* <show picture of me on a boat>
* Did my PhD at the Natural History Museum, London. 
* Have a formal background in nematode taxonomy, transitioned over to bioinformatics work during my postdoc. No formal computer science backgroud, self-taught programming (I'm "just like you!") 
* My lab broadly uses genomics tools to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses in marine invertebrates (nematodes and other microbial metazoa), but we also do software development.
* Teach SWC workshop because I understand the struggle! Want to help biologists feel less overwhelmed / confused in their quest to gain computational skills.
